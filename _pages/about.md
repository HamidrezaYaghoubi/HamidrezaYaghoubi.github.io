<div class="about-content" style="width: 100% !important; max-width: none !important;">
I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/" target="_blank">Ming Lin</a>. Previously, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked with Professor <a href="https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/" target="_blank">Mahdieh Soleymani</a>, and Professor <a href="https://sharif.edu/~rohban/index.html" target="_blank">Mohammad Hossein Rohban</a>.

<p>
  My research is dedicated to building trustworthy, safety-critical AI systems that people can rely on. Currently, I pursue two complementary lines of work:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Behavior-informed trajectory forecasting</strong> for autonomous vehicles, where models learn human driving styles to support robust interaction with other road users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Efficiency-versus-safety trade-offs</strong> in learning-based algorithms, investigating how to balance resource use and risk management in critical applications.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Together, these efforts aim to advance AI that not only performs well across diverse real-world scenarios but also upholds the rigorous safety guarantees needed for human trust.
