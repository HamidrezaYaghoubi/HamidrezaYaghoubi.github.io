I am currently a first year CE Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, supervised by Professor [Ming Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/).

Previously, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked with Professor [Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/), and Professor [Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.edu/~rohban/index.html).

My research interests lie in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. More specifically, I'm interested in developing and optimizing models and algorithms to address real-world challenges. Previously, I conducted research on projects such as **Traffic Forecasting** and **Generalization** across different distributions. Currently, I'm researching **Trajectory Forecasting** based on different personality types.
