I am currently a first year CE Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, supervised by Professor [Ming Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/).

Previously, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked with Professor [Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/), and Professor [Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.edu/~rohban/index.html).

My research interests lie in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. More specifically, I'm interested in developing and optimizing models and algorithms to address real-world challenges. Previously, I conducted research on projects such as **Traffic Forecasting** and **Generalization** across different distributions. Currently, I'm researching **Trajectory Forecasting** based on different personality types.

TPASI stands as one of Iranâ€™s largest and most technologically advanced companies. Notable projects I contributed to include:

- **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA):** Investigated and developed traffic prediction models, improving ETA accuracy using techniques inspired by industry best practices.
- **Location Search Engine:** Processed raw data and built an in-house search engine with optimized offline and online metrics.
- **GPS Denoising:** Applied noise reduction techniques to enhance GPS data quality and reliability for location-based services.
- **Destination Suggestion:** Built ML models to recommend destinations based on user ride data.
