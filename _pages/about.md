I am currently a first year CE Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, supervised by Professor [Ming Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/).

Previously, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked with Professor [Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/), and Professor [Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.edu/~rohban/index.html).

My research interests lie in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. More specifically, I'm interested in developing and optimizing models and algorithms to address real-world challenges. Previously, I conducted research on projects such as **Traffic Forecasting** and **Generalization** across different distributions. Currently, I'm researching **Trajectory Forecasting** based on different personality types.

Work Experience
======
**TAPSI, Iranian Ride-Hailing Company**  
*Tehran, Iran*  
*Feb 2021 - Feb 2023*  

TPASI stands as one of Iran’s largest and most technologically advanced companies. Notable projects I contributed to include:

- **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA):** Investigated many ETA models such as Graph Neural Networks used in Google Maps, but the most remarkable one was a post-processing model I developed based on **Lyft’s post-process model**, which led to a significant decrease in the MAPE and an increase in finished rides. My investigation on our traffic dataset resulted in a remarkable **60x** acceleration in ETA model prediction speed by finding the bottleneck of our data preparation pipeline.
- **Location Search Engine:** Preparation and processing of raw data, as well as the design and implementation of an in-house location search engine. Developed and defined offline and online metrics that are correlated with each other and aligned with key business objectives.
- **GPS Denoising:** Worked on noise reduction techniques for GPS data, enhancing data quality and reliability, which is critical for precise location-based services and ETA calculations.
- **Destination Suggestion:** Developed machine learning models to recommend destinations to a user based on her/his ride data.
