<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently a first-year CE Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, supervised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/" target="_blank">Ming Lin</a>. Previously, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked with Professor <a href="https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/" target="_blank">Mahdieh Soleymani</a>, and Professor <a href="https://sharif.edu/~rohban/index.html" target="_blank">Mohammad Hossein Rohban</a>.

My research interests lie in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. More specifically, I'm interested in developing and optimizing models and algorithms to address real-world challenges. Previously, I conducted research on projects such as <strong>Traffic Forecasting</strong> and <strong>Generalization</strong> across different distributions. Currently, I'm researching  <strong>Trajectory Forecasting</strong> based on different personality types.

TPASI stands as one of Iranâ€™s largest and most technologically advanced companies. Notable projects I contributed to include:

- **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA):** Investigated and developed traffic prediction models, improving ETA accuracy using techniques inspired by industry best practices.
- **Location Search Engine:** Processed raw data and built an in-house search engine with optimized offline and online metrics.
- **GPS Denoising:** Applied noise reduction techniques to enhance GPS data quality and reliability for location-based services.
- **Destination Suggestion:** Built ML models to recommend destinations based on user ride data.
